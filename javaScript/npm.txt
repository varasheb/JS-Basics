The main difference between .js and .mjs files in Node.js lies in the module system they use.

.js files: By default, these are treated as CommonJS modules, which use require and module.
exports for importing and exporting modules. This is the original module system in Node.js.


.mjs files: These are treated as ECMAScript (ES6) modules, which use import and export. 
This system is a more recent standard and Node.js has added support for it to enable the use of modern JavaScript features.

In essence, the .mjs extension explicitly tells Node.js to treat the file as an ES6 module,
 while .js files are treated according to the projectâ€™s configuration, 
 which is CommonJS by default unless specified otherwise in package.json1.
